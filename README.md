# mnmPlayer
A simple native MacOS audio player aimed to have minimal resource consumption...
* The product (application) works but the project is incomplete yet...

## Planned properties of the product:

1. Native media APIs
    * Uses the new AV*Player APIs.
2. Minimal CPU usage when active, -almost- none when idle.
    * Less than 2% when playing audio, -almost- none when idle.
3. Minimal memory usage.
    * Less than 20MB real memory usage, for now...
4. Minimal -distributed- application size
    * Less than 10MB for now, will be significantly less when Apple embeds Swift runtime into MacOS.

## Swift developers and graphics designers are needed...
