# mnmPlayer
A simple and native Mac (OS X) audio player aimed to have minimal resource usage...
* There extists a working product (application) but the project is incomplete yet...

## Planned properties of the product:

1. Native media APIs
    * Uses the new AV*Player APIs.
2. Minimal CPU usage when active, -almost- none when idle.
    * Less than 2% when playing audio, -almost- none when idle.
3. Minimal memory usage.
    * Less than 20MB real memory usage, for now...
4. Minimal -distributed- application size
    * Less than 10MB for now, will be significantly less when Apple embeds Swift runtime into MacOS.

## Help Wanted!:

### Swift / Mac Developers are needed
    * for -general- development process
### Graphics Designers are needed
    * for application / button icons (svg,png)
